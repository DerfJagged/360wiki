# How to Contribute to the Xbox 360 Modding Scene

### You might think the average person can't, but *ANYONE* can!



You can help by [preserving your hardware](https://360.consolemods.org/repairguide/preservation/index.html) and [keeping your KV unbanned](https://360.consolemods.org/modguide/xboxlive/preventbans.html) as there are limited amounts of these as the hardware is no longer produced and KVs are even more limited in availability. You can also [contribute to the wiki](https://360.consolemods.org/contribute/wiki/index.html).
