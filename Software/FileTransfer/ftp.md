# FileZilla

------

[FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) allows you to transfer files can be transferred to and from your Xbox  360. On a custom dashboard, an FTP server will always be running in the  background. A video demonstration of how to use FileZilla can be found  on [MrMario2011's channel](https://youtu.be/QVxGZIbRZ_w?list=PL1CadovfabPskGb2Ur4kBGzD5s7DzQw5I).

1. Make sure you have either an Ethernet or WiFi connection between your Xbox 360 and PC.
2. Take note of your Xbox's IP address. It should be on the dashboard.
3. Open a [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) session and enter your Xbox's IP into the host field in the top left,  and "xbox" as the username and password. Press enter to connect.
4. In the right-hand side, you should see a directory listing of the different partitions on the drive. 
5. You can browse your PC on the left-hand side and upload or download  files by right clicking them and choosing the relevant option on either  session. Choosing "Add to Queue" will save the transfer into a list, and pressing Ctrl+P will start processing the list; this is handy if you  are not yet ready to transfer large amounts of files.
