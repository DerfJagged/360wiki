In the past, Netflix has required Xbox Live Gold, a valid keyvault  and stealth in order to access it on a JTAG/RGH. Recently, the  requirements were changed and you can now access it using the official  app. This method is working as of September 24th, 2017.

## Installation for JTAG/RGH

1. Download the Netflix app and the Optional Media update from [here](https://mega.nz/#!zV0hFBCZ!BoFwNgHuJCCh1RXk90tMyB8UcNdWYcciJZQ-vLqCLXM).
2. Open the Optional Media Update folder and copy FFFE07DF to your Xbox 360 in HDD\Content\0000000000000000. Do the same for 394707D1 in the  Netflix folder.
3. Open the Netflix app from the dashboard. It will give you an error.  Go back to the dashboard and open Netflix again. After it loads, it  should prompt you to login to your Netflix. If not, make sure that XHTTP is enabled in DashLaunch.
