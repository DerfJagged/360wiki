# Setting up a Xbox 360 Development Environment on Windows 10

Disclaimer: This is purely for educational purposes. What you do with this information is your responsibility.

## Microsoft Official SDK

First, you will need to install Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate. I recommend  disabling sending information about setup to Microsoft. Accept the  license terms and continue. Choose a full install. It will take  approximately 7 GB.

You can choose to install the following via the websetup executable or by downloading and installing them manually:

.NET Framework 4

Congrats, Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate is now installed with a trial! You can get a full version key online, just Google "Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate key"  and you'll find what you're looking for. (The buy page, ignore the ones  that are free since you wouldn't want something for free.)

Note: I have had issues with install via Web sometimes that are usually fixed by rerunning the tool and selecting repair and allowing it to reinstall what it needs to.

At this point you'll want to install the Visual Studio 2010 SDK for additional functionality and documentation.

Then install the MSXML 4.0 SP2 Parser and SDK.

Note: I am not fully certain you MUST have ALL of these things, as I haven't tested what is necessary for a "minimum" install.

Finally, install the Xbox 360 SDK that you have obtained legally and are licensed to use. Choose full installation.

Congratulations! You now have a fully functioning Xbox 360 Development Environment for  creating, compiling, debugging, and packaging software for the Xbox 360!
