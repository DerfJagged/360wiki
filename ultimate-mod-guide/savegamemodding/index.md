# USB Mods

------

While most modding capabilities require an RGH/JTAG to run unsigned  code, some mods can be performed using a USB flash drive. Essentially  all games after Modern Warfare 2 have better security which prevents  these simple mods to be used online.

In general, USB mods are limited to:

- Game save modding
- Using other people's game saves
- Changing values in your offline profile
- Making a custom gamer picture
- Making a custom theme
- Injecting DRM-free DLC and games (very few)
- Modifying your achievement score (ban risk)
- Modifying your avatar (high ban risk)

To access game saves or profiles to mod, you have to insert a USB  flash drive into your console, format it, then manually move your saves  to the flash drive. From there, data can be accessed only using a file  manager tool (one listed below), extracted, and modified to your liking.
