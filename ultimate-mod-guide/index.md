# Recommended Setup

------

This page will lead you through the basic setup of your console and [/u/Derf_Jagged](https://www.reddit.com/u/Derf_Jagged)'s recommendations of what to install. This list assumes that you have a freshly JTAG/RGH exploited console. 

------

1. If you have an early phat model, check the [cooling improvements page](https://www.reddit.com/r/360hacks/wiki/improve_cooling) for ideas to lower your system temperatures. 
2. [Disable the eFuse Burning Circuit](https://old.reddit.com/r/360hacks/wiki/efuses) so that you never have to worry about accidentally updating your system with an official update.
3. [Save a backup dump of your NAND and KV info](https://www.reddit.com/r/360hacks/wiki/nand_backup) to somewhere safe if you don't already have one. 
4. [Install XeXmenu](https://old.reddit.com/r/360hacks/wiki/XeXmenu). 
5. [Install Aurora](https://www.reddit.com/r/360hacks/wiki/aurora) and set paths to scan for games. Keep XeXmenu installed as a backup.
6. Install DashLaunch and:
   - Set target temperatures for fans to 60Â°C for CPU/GPU/EDRAM.
   - Set `default` to your Aurora XEX so it loads Aurora on bootup.
   - Set `X` to boot to the Microsoft dashboard XEX (located in flash).
   - [Block XBL](https://www.reddit.com/r/360hacks/wiki/block_xbl) if you don't plan on playing online.
7. [Modify your bootanim](https://www.reddit.com/r/360hacks/wiki/bootanim) if you want to customize your boot up animation and sound.
8. Install apps:
   - For emulating non-Xbox games: [Various Emulators](https://www.reddit.com/r/360hacks/wiki/emulators)
   - For activating locked DLC or games: [XM360](https://www.reddit.com/r/360hacks/wiki/xm360)
9. If you want to mod games, install [Xbox Neighborhood](https://www.reddit.com/r/360hacks/wiki/xbox_neighborhood) and see [this page for specific game mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/360hacks/wiki/modding).
10. Set up LiNK and/or [XLink Kai](https://www.reddit.com/r/360hacks/wiki/xlink) for system link play.
