# Optical Drive Emulators (ODE)

------

An Optical Drive Emulator is a device that allows you to run game  backups and homebrew on a Xbox 360, without requiring a jailbroken  console or custom dashboard. The majority of consoles are compatible,  with some newer slims requiring the console to be RGH exploited to  function correctly, and the newest models (Winchester) not being  compatible. Please refer to your ODE page of choice, for a table of  compatibility.
