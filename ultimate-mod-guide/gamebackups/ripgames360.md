# Ripping DVD/Game Backups

------

As Xbox 360s age, their lasers begin to degrade with use. Because of  this, it is smart to keep a backup of your game library to be played  digitally. On an unmodified console, you have the option to rip games to the hard drive, playable off of the hard drive by inserting the disc  for a license check. On a RGH/JTAG, you can make a complete rip of the  disc, which is playable without having the disc inserted. Alternatively, you can install games to hard drive with an unmodified console, move  them to a USB device, put them on an RGH/JTAG, and play them that way.

A video demonstration of how to rip game backups can be found on [Modded Warfare's channel](https://youtu.be/wWTXja965gE?list=PLn7ji3VsPy3FCoZ5E3zWz5tS5iWbysPZX).

This process also applies to original Xbox games and DVDs.

## Ripping with FSD

1. Navigate to Utilities > DVD Extract. 
2. Select Change, browse to where you want to save the disc  contents, and press Y. The program will create a folder with the name  specified inside of the selected folder.
3. If you want to change the title of the ripped content, click the second Change button.
4. Select Start Copy and the disc will be ripped to that location.  When the process is finished, the Cancel button will disappear and you  will need to press B to go back.
   - Keep in mind that your dashboard must be set to scan the containing folder if you want it to show up in a category listing.

## Ripping with XeXmenu

1. Navigate to the file manager and to the folder you want to rip files to. Note that it will *not* create a directory, so it's recommended to make a folder for the game and enter it.
2. Press Y and scroll down to the second to bottom option, CopyDVD. Press A on it and it will open the disc tray.
3. Place the DVD in the disc tray, close it, and press Confirm. The disc will be ripped to that location.
