# Using a Custom Profile Picture

------

If you want to use a custom profile picture, you can do so via Xbox  website trickery or through injecting images into your profile. For  unmodified consoles it's best to use the website trick, as profile  injection can lead to an Xbox Live ban if detected.

## Via Profile Injection

You will need:

- A flash drive
- Your custom PNG in 64x64 and 32x32
- [Horizon](https://digiex.net/threads/horizon-xbox-360-usb-modding-tool-download-2-7-6-7.13328/)

1. From the original dashboard, plug your flash drive into your Xbox 360 and navigate to Console Settings > Storage. Move your profile  onto the flash drive..
2. Plug your flash drive into your PC. Right click and run Horizon  as Administrator and open the Device Explorer tab on the left side.  Select Gamer Profile, and double click Profile to open the profile  manager window. 
   - If your device does not show up, you will need to click the Tools  tab at the top > Package Manager > Open > Browse to your flash  drive > Content, and open the one file on your flash drive. You may  need to set Windows to show hidden files. 
3. Select the Contents tab at the top, and find tile_64.png. Right  click it and choose "Replace...". Select the tile_64.png you created and click Open. Repeat this process for tile_32.png.
4. Click the orange Save, Rehash, and Resign tab at the top. A  backup of your profile will also be created in the same directory,  ending in .bak. Rename this file to remove the ".bak" if you wish to  roll back.
5. Eject your flash drive and plug it into your Xbox 360. Move the  profile back over to your hard drive or internal storage unit and sign  in. It should display your new icons.
