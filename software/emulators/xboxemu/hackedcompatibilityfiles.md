------

By default, phat Xbox 360s come with a built in Xbox emulator.  However, the emulator would not boot all games, and later models did not include the emulator at all. This guide will walk you through  installing a hacked Xbox emulator which will allow you to play any  original Xbox game.

In 2019, an updated hacked compatibility pack was released which  enables the Xbox 360 guide and gamechat while playing original Xbox  games.
