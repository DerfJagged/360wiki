# King Kong (KK) Exploit

------

This tutorial requires that you are on the 4532 or 4548 kernel, which can be checked by going to System -> Console Settings -> System  Info, and that your DVD drive has been flashed or that you are using an  ODE. This equates to any console that hasn't been updated with a  manufacturing date of January 9th, 2007 or earlier. If you are on a  lower version, update to 4532 either through USB or through burning  HD_DVD_10-2006.zip (MD5: CD4DB8E2C94266AB73513C361DD5B8F6). You will  also need an ISO of the game King Kong, *not* the classics version.

- Note that this exploit is not permanent and can only be used to run  Linux. It cannot be used to modify the regular Xbox 360 operating  system.

## Exploit Usage

1. Download [embedded_xell.zip](). If using Windows, download cygwin1.dll and place it under `C:\Windows\System32\`. If using Linux, you will need to compile the source. 
2. Place shader.bin, the EXE, and your King Kong IOS in the same folder. Open command prompt, navigate to the directory, and run `win_patch.exe <name of iso>` or, if using Linux, `./linux_patch <name of iso>`. 
3. Burn the patched ISO to a disc.
4. Download a [LiveCD](https://sourceforge.net/projects/free60/files/liveCDs/) made for the Xbox 360 and burn it to a disc.
5. Turn on your Xbox 360 and run the burned King Kong disc. Press  Start on the title screen, and wait for the disc tray to open. Insert  the Linux CD and close the tray. Linux will boot up.
6. (Optional) You can run a script, which may be found on the Linux desktop, to install Linux to your hard drive. Note that this **will wipe your Xbox 360 HDD**.
