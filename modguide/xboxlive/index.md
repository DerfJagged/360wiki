# Connecting to Xbox Live on a JTAG/RGH Console

------

JTAG/RGH console users must take special precautions when connecting  to Xbox Live in order to avoid getting banned instantly or within a few  hours of connecting. Stealth server services such as NiNJA, XBLBallin,  XBonline, Teapot, or Variant Live exist to be a means of connecting  "safely" to Xbox Live. Be aware that it is never 100% safe to connect to Xbox Live with a modified console and you may get your console and/or  account banned.
