# Game Modding (RGH/JTAG)

------

With a RGH/JTAG, you have the ability to modify games. Generally,  there are pre-made modified game files that you can swap out on your  hard drive-installed games, but some games have easy to use tools for  creating your own mods or poking values live from your PC. For USB based mods, see [the USB modding page](https://360.consolemods.org/modguide/gamemodding/index.html).
