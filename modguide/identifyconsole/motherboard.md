### Motherboard

All motherboards except the Winchester motherboard are exploitable with the RGH.

### Use the [motherboard identification chart](http://i.imgur.com/Dcf9hQ4.png) to determine what kind of motherboard you have.







Use the [motherboard identification chart](http://i.imgur.com/Dcf9hQ4.png) to determine what kind of motherboard you have. Note the watts (W) and  amperage (A) ratings for each model, and compare it with the one on the  back of the console above the barcode. Generally, Trinity consoles are  glossy, and Coronas are matte; but this is not always the case.

Winchester boards can be  differentiated from a Corona board by [looking through the side vent with a flashlight](http://web.archive.org/save/_embed/https://obrazki.elektroda.pl/5184821800_1418893002.jpg) or by looking at the GPU and seeing if it is a [Corona v6](https://weekendmodder.com/images/corona_xcgpu.png) or [Winchester](https://weekendmodder.com/images/winchester_xcgpu.png).

- **A Winchester board is not exploitable in any way. This includes RGH/JTAG, drive flashing, and ODEs.**
