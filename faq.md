# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q. Why did you make this wiki? There's other wikis out there.**

A. This wiki is the wiki to outwiki all wikis. The features provided by GitHub allow this to be so versatile, open, and community-built wiki for the Xbox scene. And **THAT**'s cool.

**Q. What equipment do you recommend for soldering?**

A. 

| A soldering iron with a controllable temperature knob, the higher the wattage the faster it will heat up | Leaded solder (*not* lead free)                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| No-clean liquid flux (Kester 951 preferably)                 | 30AWG solid core wire, preferably shielded (28AWG is a more expensive but easier to work with) |
| Wire strippers that can handle 30AWG/28AWG wires, respectively | Flush cutters (any wire cutter will do, but flush ones are more precise) |
| A brass wool tip cleaner                                     | Isopropyl alcohol (99%)                                      |
| Cotton swabs                                                 |                                                              |
|                                                              |                                                              |
|                                                              |                                                              |
|                                                              |                                                              |
|                                                              |                                                              |
|                                                              |                                                              |
