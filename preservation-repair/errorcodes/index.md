# Error Codes

------

This page is intended to be a comprehensive list of all error codes  for all models of Xbox 360, as well as tutorials on fixing them if  applicable/possible. This error code guide is in no way official and may not be 100% accurate as it is community sourced. If you discover  something that is incorrect or not included please [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2F360hacks) to have it updated. **We take no responsibility for any actions you may take to fix your console.**

Generally, if there is a problem with the Xbox 360, the LEDs in the  Ring of Light (ROL) around the power button will flash in a particular  pattern. The pattern itself lends some insight to the problem. Certain  patterns will also display numbered error codes on screen, known as your primary error code, which will further help diagnose your console's  issue.

Officially documented descriptions of the errors can be found on [Octal's RROD Database](https://errors.octalsXboxshop.com/) (officially documented errors).

## Ring of Light Error Codes

Determining the malfunctioning component of your Xbox 360 depends on how many red lights around the power button are flashing.

### One Red Light

If the bottom right red light is flashing on your Xbox 360, then your console is experiencing a hardware error. The console will still power  on, and should display an error code on the screen it is connected to.  The code will begin with an E, followed by two digits. Some in-depth  error code information can be found on this page below. The Specific  Type of hardware failure can be determined by the error code displayed  on the screen. If the screen is blank or you would like additional  information follow the instructions for determining the secondary error  code in the section for it below.

### Two Red Lights

When the left two lights are flashing red on the console, a component is overheating. It is likely that the fan will be running very loudly.  Shut the console off and let it cool down for a couple hours. To prevent this from happening in the future, make sure your Xbox 360 is in a  well-ventilated area and out of the immediate proximity of any walls,  heaters, or other appliances. Alternatively Overheating can be cause by  the console locking up or "freezing" after a set amount of time. Lockups that occur at a specific point in a game are generally problems with  the game itself and not caused by overheating. Let the Xbox 360 console  cool. You may have to wait several hours for the console to cool enough. Do not turn on the console when the console is hot. Verify that the  console has sufficient ventilation and that the fan is operating. For  more information about ventilation, see the Care page. To try to prevent this problem, use the following precautions: Do not block any  ventilation openings on the Xbox 360 console, Do not put the Xbox 360  console on a bed, on a sofa, or on any other soft surface that may block ventilation openings, Do not put the Xbox 360 console in a confined  space, such as a bookcase, a rack, or a stereo cabinet, unless the space is well-ventilated, Do not put the Xbox 360 console near any heat  source, such as a radiator, a heat register, a stove, or an amplifier.

### Three Red Lights ("Red Ring of Death")

The "Red Ring of Death" has occurred when all but the top right  corner of the light ring are flashing red. A general hardware  malfunction has occurred, affecting one or more components. The error  message is not displayed directly, since the console doesn't power on,  but it is possible to obtain the secondary error code from the Xbox. Most, if not all, three-light errors in Xbox 360 consoles are related to overheating. The most common issue is a cracked or cold solder joint  underneath the GPU on the motherboard. A flaw in the design of the heat  sink allows the motherboard to warp in the area around the chip, which  causes the chip to lose contact with the board. There are various fixes  for the RROD, which include replacing the high-stress x-clamp, reflowing the GPU's solder connection, and also replacing the heat sink in older  models with Microsoft's updated Zephyr heat sink. To keep your Xbox 360 from being affected by the RROD, keep it in a  well-ventilated area and make sure the cooling vents are free from  obstruction. If your Xbox begins to overheat, turn the power off and  allow it to cool for at least an hour before continuing play.  Alternatively, use an external fan to help circulate air across the  device. If the RROD is already plaguing your Xbox, and your console is no longer covered by Microsoft's warranty, there is hope yet. Even though the  console will not turn on, you can obtain a secondary error code from it. After pinpointing the cause of your Xbox's RROD, you can take the  necessary action to remove the problem. Red Ring errors caused by the  CPU or GPU are normally fixed by installing a Red Ring of Death Fix Kit. Try restarting the console. If restarting the console does not resolve  the behavior, follow these steps: Turn the console off, Unplug all the  power and AV cables from the console, Unplug the power cord from the  wall socket, Firmly reconnect all the cables, Turn on the console. If  these steps do not resolve the behavior, turn the console off, remove  the hard drive, and then turn on the console. If the 3x Red LED error  light is no longer displayed, turn the console off, re-attach the hard  drive, and then turn on the console. Also examine the lights on the  power supply. When you turn on the console, the power supply light  should illuminate green even if the three lights on the ROL flash red. 

### Four Red Lights Flashing

The Xbox 360 A/V cable is not connected. Make sure that the AV cable  is correctly connected to the Xbox 360 console. Reconnect the cable  either to the console or the display you are using. Disconnect the AV  cable from the Xbox 360 console, and then reconnect the AV cable to the  Xbox 360 console. If the four flashing red lights continue to flash, try wiping the metal area of the AV pack with a dry cloth. The metal area  is the end that plugs into the console. Wipe the metal area thoroughly,  and then try the AV Pack again. If the AV cable is correctly connected  but the four red lights are still flashing, substitute a different AV  cable if you have one available. 

#### Manufacture Mode (Xmas Lights)

Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 are flashing red and green. If you attempted  the JTAG hack, restore your original NAND image and/or reflow the  Southbridge. Be aware that Xenon keyvaults have a Type 1 keyvault, while all other Xbox 360s have a Type 2 keyvault. Either type can be used on a Xenon, but a Type 1 keyvault cannot be used on a newer console or else  you will get this error.

| E64    | 1000      | Bad DVD flash / dead flash chip(Timeout) | Check DVD power and SATA cable for damage and replace  if necessary. Make sure any modifications have been installed properly.  Flash chip may need desoldering and reflashing with an external  progRAMmer, recover DVD key if possible(unless you have backup) | This error occurs if something goes wrong while  flashing the drive or installing a modchip. A sign for it is that the  DVD drive doesn't eject the tray anymore. DVD drive timed out during  reset. It can also be caused by a faulty DVD power or SATA cable. |
| E65    | 1001      | Bad DVD flash / dead flash chip (DMA)    | Ensure all modifications are installed properly. Try to reflash the correct firmware to the drive. The flash chip must be  desoldered and reflashed with an external progRAMmer, recover DVD-key if possible(unless you have a backup). | This error occurs if something goes wrong while  flashing the drive or installing a modchip. A sign for it is that the  DVD drive can still be flashed and read out. DVD drive is not DMA  configured. |
| E66    | 1002      | Wrong DVD drive version                  | Reflash the firmware with the correct Vendor version string using your computer. | This error occurs when you replace the DVD drive and  forget to spoof it with the correct version string of the drive you  replaced. |
| E67    | 1003      | Broken Hard drive (Timeout)              | Replace hard drive. Also worth trying Southbridge X-Clamp fix and reflow the Southbridge. | This error occurs when your hard drive is defective, it might still work sometimes. Hard drive timed out during reset. There is also a small chance that it is a cold joint under the Southbridge  causing problems with the I/O of the HDD. |
| E68    | 1010      | Broken Hard drive (DMA)                  | Replace hard drive. Worth trying Southbridge X-Clamp fix and reflow Southbridge. | If you recently used it with a computer it may have  gotten a faulty security sector. This error occurs when your hard drive  is defective, it might still work sometimes.... It can also happen  because of a bad EEPROM or a wrong security sector.It can also be a  problem with the internal connection of the hard drive to the  mainboard...Hard drive not DMA configured. |
| E69    | 1011      | Broken Hard drive (HDDSS)                | Unplug hard drive and plug back in. Restore HDDSS.bin(hard drive security sector backup). Replace hard drive. | This error occurs when your hard drives security sector is unreadable, if you have played around with that make sure to have  the correct security sector on the drive.... However it could also just  be defective and trigger the error because of that. |
| E70    | 1012      | HDD Error Filesystem/Not Found           | N/A                                                          | HDD Error (Corrupt Filesystem/partitions) or Hard drive not found |
| E71    | 1013      | Dashboard update error (NAND related)    | Patch for the fall update / Insert the NXE Update disk  before the error screen appears. Reflow Southbridge and Southbridge  X-Clamp fix. If software related, JTAG/RGH may be able to fix it. | This error is related to a failed dashboard update, can also be NAND related if you have an Infectus chip.... It can also often be caused by a cold joint under the Southbridge (if it wasn't caused by an update). Error within Xam |
| E72    | 1020      | NAND issue (loose pin/ bad flash)        | Patch for the fall update / Insert the NXE Update disc  before the error screen pops up. Reflow Southbridge and Southbridge  X-Clamp fix. JTAG/RGH may fix. | This error is related to a loose pin or a not existent  NAND chip, can also happen if you flashed it badly with an Infectus chip and/or the NAND is dead.... Error within Xam |
| E73    | 1021      | Cold solder joint - Ethernet/Southbridge | Southbridge X-Clamp fix and reflow Southbridge. Check  area under Southbridge for parts that may have fallen off/floated out of position and place them back on. Rarely, it can be GPU related, so GPU  reflow & X-Clamp fix may help. | This error is caused by a cold solder joint under the  Southbridge or the ethernet chip. In rare cases it can also be triggered by a cold joint under the GPU on one of the lines that run to the  Southbridge chip. Missing parts(caps, resistors...) under the  Southbridge can trigger this error as well. |
| E74    | 1022      | Cold solder joint under GPU- (H)ANA      | If you soldered anything to the mainboard before it  occurred, whatever you are powering from this point is drawing too much  power so get rid of it.Also get rid of everything that you can see that  might bridge anything near the GPU. Tighten the GPU screws facing the  HANA chip slightly more and make sure to be using a shim. Adding an  extra shim on each side of the smaller chip dye will help to create more surface against the heatsink and will increase the chances of the error going away for good. If there is a lot of flexing under the GPU, [bake the board](https://www.reddit.com/r/360hacks/wiki/360-cooking) to unflex it. Reflow the GPU and HANA chip. | This error is caused by a cold solder joint under the  GPU, (H)ANA-chip or in between. Mostly it is one of the outer solder  balls on the side facing the (H)ANA chip so a shim increases the chanced of success quite a bit. Can also be a component that is missing or  damaged so look for missing parts near the GPU and the (H)ANA chip. |
| E75    | 1023      | Network chip cold joint / wrong vendor   | Connect the DVD drive and check if the error code is  still the same... Remove everything you might have soldered to this  area. Reflow the Southbridge and Network chip. Replace the Network chip. | This error is related to the network chip, might be  power related or so.This can happen while installing and NME 2. In  general it sounds like a cold solder joint somewhere there.However it  can also be a Hitachi DVD drive that is not connected... Couldn't read  ethernet phy vendor/wrong ethernet vendor. |
| E76    | 1030      | Dead network chip                        | Replace the Network chip. Connect the DVD drive and  check if the error code is still the same. Remove everything you might  have soldered to this area. Reflow the Southbridge and Network chip. | This error is caused by a dead network chip. This can  happen when lightning hits your house and the network chip is under high voltage. Couldn't complete ethernet reset. |
| E77    | 1031      | Dead network chip                        | Replace the Network chip and other damaged components  around it like blown capacitors defective regulators etc. Also reflowing Southbridge and Network chip can help | This error is caused by a dead network chip. It can  occur when your house gets hit in a thunderstorm... phy request is  already processing/ reading reg failed/ Failed to write reg. |
| E78    | 1032      | AsicId check failed                      | N/A                                                          | AsicId check failed                                          |
| E79    | 1033      | Broken hard drive (Xam.xex)              | Replace hard drive. Try Southbridge X-Clamp fix and  reflow Southbridge. Check JTAG wiring! Especially the diodes they MUST  face the correct direction - Away from J2D2. | This error occurs when your hard drive is defective, it might still work sometimes.... There is also a small chance that it is a cold joint under the Southbridge causing problems with the I/O of the  HDD. It can also be related to wiring the diodes while JTAGing. Couldn't start xam.xex. |
| E80    | 1100      | NAND - Wrong LDV Version                 | Downgrade to the old dashboard, solder the resistor  back on and then update your Xbox. If you have the CPU Key, get the  current NAND Flash image and fix the LDV (Just add 1 up to latest  kernel). | Wrong LDV version in NAND Flash. You have the new  dashboard update but not the resistor R3T6, follow known fixes to see  how to resolve the problem. |

| E04    | 0010      | Cold solder joint under Southbridge OR bad RF board          | Try another RF board. If LEDs were modded, try removing them. Southbridge X-Clamp replacement. Southbridge reflow. Check the  are under the Southbridge for parts that might have fallen off and  solder them back on. | There is a problem with the Southbridge Chip usually  dealing with how it connects to the mainboard (cold solder joint/bridged solder joints)(Taken from Xbox-Scene) |
| E08    | 0020      | Bridged solder joint/short - CPU/GPU/RAM                     | If you worked on the mainboard recently(soldered or so) remove these wires because you might be drawing too much power from the GPU. Also look for missing/bridged components like  capacitors/resistors. If you JTAG hacked the console, remove wires and  resistors, the parallel port can stay as long as no PC is connected.  X-Clamp replacement. Flush with alcohol, let dry, begin reflow with flux like below. Reflow GPU and RAM area. Reball GPU and RAM for bridged  solder. | This error is caused by a bridged solder joint under  CPU, GPU or one of the RAM bricks. This effect can also be caused by tin whiskers leading to shorts and if the GPU was taken off the mainboard  this error will also show up. It can also be power related(the CPU/GPU  or RAM isn't getting enough power). Can also be a component that is  missing or damaged so look for missing and bridged parts near the GPU.  If the console was JTAGged and the resistors and cables are still  connected it will show 0020, the parallel port can stay as long as no PC is connected. |
| E09    | 0021      | Bridged solder joint/Short - GPU/Southbridge                 | If you worked on the mainboard recently(soldered or so) remove these wires because you might be drawing too much power from the Southbridge. Also look for missing/bridged components like  capacitors/resistors. X-Clamp replacement. Southbridge X-Clamp fix.  Reflow Southbridge/Ethernet chip area. Reball the Southbridge - bridged  solder. If you work in dumping lite-on 8xxxx and 9xxxx with jumper,  Check your DVD drive motherboard again, if there's still some shorting.  Wrong GPU model (e.g. Zephyr/Falcon GPU reballed onto a Xenon board). | This error is caused by a bridged solder joint under  GPU or Southbridge. It can also be power related(the Southbridge isn't  getting enough power). Can also be a component that is missing or  damaged so look for missing and bridged parts(caps etc) near the  Southbridge. |
| E10    | 0022      | Bridged solder joint/Short GPU-> (H)ANA                      | If you soldered anything to the mainboard before it  occurred, whatever you are powering from this point is drawing too much  power so get rid of it.Also get rid of everything that you can see that  might bridge anything near the GPU. X-Clamp replacement. Reflow GPU and  HANA chip. Reflow GPU and HANA chip. Reflow CPU. If using JTAG on  JTAG-fixed Xbox 360 this will appear, flash to original NAND. Can be  caused by broken trace. | This error is caused by a bridged/shorting solder joint under the GPU, (H)ANA-chip or in between. It can also be power related  though, for example if you are drawing power from one of the regulators  that power the GPU and HANA-chip. Can also be a component that is  missing or damaged so look for missing parts near the GPU and the HANA  chip. In extremely rare cases it might also be related to the lines that lead from HANA to the CPU. The chances are however higher that it is  the GPU than the HANA chip so you should always first concentrate on the GPU. Another cause could be due to a broken trace under the board near  one of the RAM blocks ([picture](https://i.imgur.com/z06x9Ag.jpg)). This error also shows up if the CPU was taken off the mainboard. |
| E11    | 0023      | (unknown) probably a short under Southbridge>ANA             | N/A                                                          | This error is unknown but assumed to be a short either  under Southbridge and (H)ANA chip or in between these. Look for 0021 and 0022 and reflow the Southbridge-> HANA chip area, the X-Clamp Fix  might help as well. |
| E12    | 0030      | Temp sensor problem/ Cold solder joint under CPU             | Replace X-Clamps. Reflow CPU. Cut CPU temp sensor trace (NOT RECOMMENDED!) | The temp sensor is not working properly, maybe because  it is shorting out (2 bridged solder balls). If it's completely broken,  you may need to cut the trace anyway. |
| E13    | 0031      | Faulty RAM brick/ Shorted out resistor                       | Reflow RAM and Southbridge. Loosen heatsink screws and  make sure heatsink isn't shorting out a capacitor. Replace faulty RAM  brick. X-Clamp replacement. Replace DVD power cord. Unbridged U6T1 or  U6T2(points that protect CPU-fuse) | This error is caused by a faulty/cracked RAM brick,  however it can also be caused when the heatsink is shorting out a  resistor or like a bad solder joint under the GPU?, check out the links  in the references... Also caused by the Southbridge if not properly  soldered to motherboard or if it experiences a power short. Can be  caused by a backwards power cord or faulty power cord to DVD player. If  you update to freeboot 9199 with bridged U6T1 or U6T2 this error will  appear, unbridged it. |

1. Power the console on so the red lights are flashing.
2. Press and hold the small white Sync button and press the Eject button.
3. The LEDs will now blink the first number in the code (see number table below).
4. Release the eject button and press it again.
5. The LEDs will now blink the second number of the code.
6. Release the eject button and press it again.
7. The LEDs will now blink the third number of the code.
8. Release the eject button and press it again.
9. The LEDs will now blink the forth number of the code.
10. Release the eject button and press it again.

| Number of Lights Flashing | Error Digit |
| ------------------------- | ----------- |
| Four                      | 0           |
| One                       | 1           |
| Two                       | 2           |
| Three                     | 3           |
