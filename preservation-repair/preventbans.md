# Preventing Bans on Xbox 360

### Blocking Xbox Live

Removing your console's access to the internet is one way of doing  this, but you lose network connectivity and functions like FTP. The two  steps below will disable Xbox Live access for the console in all  scenarios.

1. Open DashLaunch, navigate to Network, and enable the following two options:
   - **liveblock**: When enabled, known Xbox Live sites are blocked. Xbox Marketplace data can still be accessed.
   - **livestrong**: Requires liveblock to be enabled. When enabled, all Xbox Live sites are blocked, including Xbox Marketplace data sources.
2. On the Microsoft dashboard, navigate to System Settings >  Family Settings > Console Controls > Xbox Live Access, and set it  to Blocked.
